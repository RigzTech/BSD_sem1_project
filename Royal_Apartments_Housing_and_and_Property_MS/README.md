Royal Apartments Rentals, Housing, and Property Management System
Section 1: Background
The problem of housing especially in the urban centers and cities of different countries of 
the world has led different people to live in poor and low standard housing facilities, like in 
slums. This problem has enabled governments, investors, and ordinary people with the ability to 
construct private and decent rental property to invest much in the construction of more affordable 
rental units to help reduce the rapidly increasing housing problem. However, property 
management problem may arise in a situation where a landlord has more rental houses situated in 
different places. This system will help the property owners to keep clear track of the tenants’ 
information, including adding and removing nonexistent tenants from the system, enable the 
tenants to report on the conditions of their rooms, and easily get the updated of their rent and 
bills from the system.
Section 2: Introduction
Royal Apartment Rental, and Property Management system will play a key role in ensuring 
that different rental housing units and related property is managed adequately regardless of 
geographical barriers which may exist between the property, property owners and landlords, and 
the tenants. Other problems which the system will help solve include:
➢ Difficulty in collecting and managing tenant information: Without a system that securely 
stores and manages tenant information, landlords may struggle to collect and organize 
tenant data. This can lead to confusion and inefficiency.
➢ Difficulty in providing affordable housing: Without a system that helps landlords and 
tenants to find suitable and affordable rental properties, tenants may struggle to find a 
place to live. This can lead to homelessness and increase the housing crisis.
➢ Difficulty in ensuring the maintenance and improvement of the properties: Without a 
system that helps landlords and tenants to schedule and keep track of the maintenance 
and improvement of the properties, the properties may deteriorate and decrease in value, 
which can lead to dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction on both sides. Inefficient
communication and organization: Without a centralized platform for managing rental 
properties, landlords and tenants may struggle to communicate effectively and stay 
organized. This can lead to confusion and misunderstandings, which can ultimately result 
in disputes and legal issues.
➢ Lack of transparency and trust: Without a clear and transparent system for managing 
rental properties, landlords and tenants may struggle to trust each other. This can result in 
mistrust and dissatisfaction on both sides.
➢ High turnover rates: Without a system that automates tasks and streamlines 
communication, landlords may struggle to keep their properties occupied. This can lead 
to high turnover rates, which can result in lost revenue and increased expenses.
➢ Difficulty in managing multiple properties: Landlords with multiple properties may 
struggle to manage them effectively without a centralized system. This can lead to 
confusion and inefficiency, which can ultimately result in lost revenue.
Some of the functionalities of this system include:
• Sign in
• User registration
• Add new users and remove the old user
• View each tenant’s details, bills, and rent
• Show the Status of the rooms
Section 3: Problem Statement
The current manual processes used for managing and maintaining the properties and 
apartments in the Royal Apartments Rentals portfolio are time-consuming, prone to errors, and 
do not provide tenants with a satisfactory level of service. This leads to high turnover rates and 
difficulty in retaining tenants, resulting in lost revenue and increased costs. There is a need for a 
more efficient, automated system that can streamline the management and maintenance of 
properties and apartments, while also providing tenants with a higher level of service and 
support.
Some of the root problems which makes it appropriate for the development of the system
are among; Difficulty in keeping the records of the tenant information, property details, and the 
rental agreements, the problem of physically processing of tenant applications and payment of 
rents, the challenge of tracking and managing the property, and the status of the house units, It is 
difficult to manually provide useful reports and analytics, coordinating repairs and maintenance, 
and the difficulty in advertising and filling available house units
Some of the functionalities of the system would include;
• New tenant registration
• Advertising of the vacant units
• Rent and bills payment reports
• Reporting 
• Maintenance and repair alerts
Section 4: Proposed Solution
The Royal Apartments Rentals, Housing, and Property Management System will help to 
solve the various challenges revolving around the management of different rentals and housing 
units as well as property. The system will provide a more secure platform where both the tenants, 
and the management of the different property will be able to interact. Additionally, the system 
will offer an automated workflow and communication tools for coordinating maintenance and 
repairs, a tenant portal where tenants can view their leases, pay rent, submit maintenance 
requests and access other important information, a user-friendly interface that is accessible to 
both property managers and tenants, such as a web portal or mobile app, and a centralized online 
platform for advertising available units, accepting tenant applications, and processing rent 
payments.
Section 5: Objectives
The new Royal Apartments Rentals, Housing, and Property Management System is intended to 
achieve the following objectives.
Main Objective
The main objective is to develop the Royal Apartments Rentals, Housing, and Property 
Management System which will help solve the different management challenges experienced by 
both the tenants and the landlord.

that the system complies with all local regulations and laws related to rental properties, 
which can help to avoid any legal issues.
➢ To ensure the data security and privacy of both landlords and tenants: This objective aims 
to protect the personal and sensitive information of both landlords and tenants by 
implementing security measures such as encryption and firewalls.
Section 6: Literature Review
Currently, the royal Appartments uses the manual management method which include the tenants 
physically coming to the property to view the available housing units, manual payment of rent, 
manual registration and storage of tenant information, among many other inconveniencing 
manual procedures. Developing this rental, housing, and property management system will help 
to solve some of these problems associated with the manual management of a rental property. 
There are many cases where the automated management of housing units have succeeded and 
now both the tenants and the property owners have a better communication and collaboration to 
ensure that everything runs smoothly. Below are the two examples of successfully developed 
systems similar to the Royal Apartments Rentals, Housing, and Property Management System:
i. Buildium - is a cloud-based property management tool that assists landlords and property 
managers with the administration of their rental homes. Tenant screening, rent collecting, 
property upkeep, financial reporting, and compliance management are all components of 
Buildium ("Property management software features," 2022). Buildium's user-friendly 
interface, which makes it simple for users to navigate and obtain the functionality they 
require, is one of its benefits. Its smartphone app, which enables landlords and property 
managers to manage their homes while on the road, is another virtue (Sacchin, 2015). 
Buildium's cost may be a problem as it might be pricey for landlords and property 
managers with a lot of rental units.
ii. AppFolio: AppFolio is another cloud-based property management software that helps 
landlords and property managers to manage their rental properties. AppFolio's features 
include tenant screening, rent collection, property maintenance, financial reporting, and 
compliance management. One of the strengths of AppFolio is its integrations with other 
software, such as QuickBooks, which makes it easy for users to manage their financials. 
Another strength is its customer support, which is known for being responsive and 
helpful (Sacchin, 2015). A weakness of AppFolio may be its limited customization 
options, which may not be suitable for landlords and property managers with unique 
needs.
How The Proposed Sytem Is Different from Both Appfolio and Buildium
The proposed Royal Apartments Rentals, Housing, and Property Management System 
may differ from Buildium and AppFolio in several ways. Some potential differences 
could include:
• It may have more functionalities not found in Buildium or AppFolio in its feature 
list. It might include, for instance, a mechanism for renters to report maintenance 
issues online and monitor the progress of their requests or a way for tenants to 
make rent and security deposit payments online.
• It may offer greater customization options than Buildium or AppFolio, enabling 
landlords and property managers to modify the system to meet their unique 
requirements. Options for tailoring the interface, reporting, and workflow to their 
particular business processes could be among them.
• Integration with other systems: It may have different integration options than 
Buildium or AppFolio. It may integrate with a different set of accounting, CRM, 
or other systems, or have a different level of integration with the same systems.
• Pricing: It may have different pricing than Buildium or AppFolio. It may be more 
or less expensive depending on the features included, the size of the landlord's or 
property managers' properties or the number of tenants, or the level of support 
provided.
Scope
The features and functionality offered by the planned Royal Apartments Rentals, Housing, and 
Property Management System include:
• Rental property listing and marketing: Users will have the ability to create and manage 
listings for their rentals, complete with pictures and detailed descriptions, and utilize the 
system to advertise their rentals to possible tenants.
• Management of tenants: Users will have access to tenant data, including contact 
information and rental history, as well as the ability to control lease terms and rent 
obligations.
• For their properties, users will be able to file maintenance requests and track them, 
including the planning and monitoring of repairs.
• Reporting: Users will be able to create reports about their rental properties and occupants, 
including delinquency reports, occupancy rates, and rent rolls.
• Data protection: Users will have access to by putting security features like encryption, 
backup, and user access privileges in place, businesses can safeguard their data and keep 
it private.
The following will not be part of the proposed system:
• Financial management: The system won't have components for controlling money, such 
payroll or accounting.
• CRM: Features for customer relationship management, including lead tracking or sales 
forecasting, won't be included in the system.
• HR management: The system will not have HR management components, like personnel 
tracking or benefits administration.
• Functionality for managing building automation systems or smart home gadgets will not 
be included in the system.
• No functionality for managing insurance policies or claims will be included in the 
system.
Section 7: Project Constraints

Section 10: Risk Management
Royal Apartments Rentals, Housing, and Property Management System's risk 
management process entails locating, evaluating, and reducing any risks that might have an 
impact on the system's functionality and tenant satisfaction.
The following are a few potential dangers to take into account:
Financial risks: The system may be affected by adjustments in the housing market, such as a 
drop in demand or an increase in competition, which may have a negative impact on rental 
income and occupancy rates.
Legal risks: The system could be impacted by modifications to housing laws and regulations or 
by conceivable tenant-related legal problems, such as eviction or discrimination claims.
Operational risks: The system may be affected by problems with the care and maintenance of the 
buildings and apartments, such as unanticipated repairs or maintenance concerns.
Data and security risks: The system may be damaged by security flaws or other data breaches, 
which could lead to the loss or theft of private tenant information or financial data.
The risk management process would entail identifying potential risks, evaluating the likelihood 
and impact of each risk, and putting in place the necessary controls and procedures to lessen each 
risk's potential impact.
For instance, the system might incorporate a diversification strategy by investing in various sorts 
of assets in various areas, which would help to reduce financial risks. The system can involve 
routine legal reviews and adherence to housing laws and regulations to reduce legal risks. The 
system can incorporate routine maintenance and inspection schedules for the buildings and flats 
to reduce operating hazards. The system can include frequent security audits, encryption of 
critical data, and employee training on data security best practices to reduce data and security 
risks.
Section 11: Methodology
The development of the system will be based on the agile methodology which would 
include gathering and analyzing data in a gradual and iterative manner. This would include 
segmenting the entire project into smaller, more manageable pieces and working on them over 
the course of several sprints. A regularly acquisition and analysis of data throughout the project, 
taking feedback into account and making improvements as necessary to improve the operation of 
the system is also key. To make sure the system is meeting their needs and resolving any 
problems, this would need routine check-ins and evaluations with stakeholders, including 
tenants.
Data Collection
Focus groups: Focus groups with renters and other stakeholders are held to collect qualitative 
information about their opinions and experiences.
User testing: Gathering input on the system's usability and user experience by conducting user 
testing with a small group of renters.
Analytics: Examining system data to find patterns and areas for improvement, such as rental 
income, maintenance expenses, and occupancy rates.
Survey: Current and potential renters will be surveyed to learn more about their needs, 
preferences, and satisfaction with the current system.
User stories: Compiling user stories from tenants and other stakeholders to learn about their 
requirements and system usage experiences.
Development Steps
The following steps would likely be included in the process for a Royal Apartments Rentals, 
Housing, and Property Management System:
Analysis: The first stage would be to assess the situation of the housing market as it stands today. 
This would involve looking into the kinds of homes and flats that are in great demand as well as 
locating any prospective rivals.
Planning: A plan would be created based on the analysis that would outline the system's precise 
aims and objectives as well as the strategies and tactics that will be employed to achieve them. 
This strategy would probably outline the system's management and upkeep procedures as well as 
its marketing and promotion strategies.
Implementation: After the plan is in place, the system would be put into action, which would 
entail constructing or purchasing the required homes and buildings as well as putting in place the 
required infrastructure and management and upkeep systems for them.
Operations: After the system is operational, it is critical to continuously monitor and manage the 
buildings and apartments, including dealing with maintenance issues, tenant relations, and 
financial management.
Evaluation and Optimization: Monitoring the system's performance on a regular basis and 
making necessary adjustments to improve it and make sure it continues to satisfy the needs of the 
tenants and the management's objectives.
Section 12: System Resources
Royal Apartments Rentals, Housing, and Property Management System's system 
resources would be a combination of hardware, software, data storage, network infrastructure, 
human resources, legal resources, and maintenance resources to ensure the efficient operation 
and management of the properties and apartments.
Hardware Resources
To support the system's many operations and functions, the system would need a range of 
hardware resources, such as servers, PCs, and mobile phones.
Software Resources
The system would need a range of software resources, such as accounting software, property 
management software, and other specialist software, to support its varied operations.
Data management Resources: To store and manage all of the data related to the properties and 
renters, including tenant information, property information, and financial data, the system would 
need a reliable data storage solution.
Network infrastructure
To support the system's communication and data transfer requirements, the system would need a 
dependable network infrastructure, including internet access and a strong internal network.
